# School District Analysis

## Overview
Maria is a cheif data scientist for a local school district. With myself being new to the team, she has tasked me to assist with gathering data to assist with her analysis utilizing Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. We also utilized a couple datasets containing raw data from our local school district. These datasets included data specific to the [schools within the district](https://github.com/KEGANCP/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv), as well as data pertaining to the [students who attended these schools](https://github.com/KEGANCP/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv).

Upon consolidating data from these datasets with several different basis and criteria, the school district suspects some acedemic dishonesty. This finding now requires some modifications to our prior populated results. Our new objective is to provide analysis (which we will refer to below) with the absence of all scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School removed from the data, which required some refactoring within our prior code to not allow the potential dishonesty to alter our findings.
